    "text": "2.1 Summary:\nThis week’s lecture taught me that remote sensing involves gathering data from a distance, which is achieved through sensors mounted on a platform including satellites, planes and even… mobile phones.\nThis interests me because of the vast amount of available data. From the lecture, I learned that satellites revisit the same locations on Earth daily to every 16 days, continuously collecting data.\nIn the practical we used data from two multispectral sensors meaning they capture imagery across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Landsat satellites detect earth data while in orbit at a 30m resolution and have been providing the longest continuous Earth Observation record dating back to 1972. Whereas, Sentinel 2 (Beginning 2015) are a pair of satellites that monitor the earth’s land surface at a higher resolution (10-60m).\nI currently work for the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and this could be very beneficial to identify areas where there is illegal dumping of waste. For instance, multispectral imagery might be able to detect different materials in waste, such as plastics, metals, or organic matter, which may indicate illegal disposal.",

    "text": "2.2 Applications:\nOne paper by Puliti et al., used both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data to monitor above ground biomass change (AGB). Traditionally, estimating AGB has relied on field based inventory methods which can be limited in spatial coverage and temporal frequency. However, this paper  found that satellite data provided valuable additional data that improved the accuracy of AGB change estimates. Sentinel-2 was preferred over Landsat due to its higher spatial resolution, but landsat was helpful for historical analysis as its been operational since the early 1970s.",

    "text": "2.3 Reflection:\nFrom the practical, the differences between Sentinel-2 and Landsat were clear. The contrast in imagery from the Landsat and Sentinel-2 can differ, and this is due to the differences in their sensor characteristics and processing methods. Landsat provides a 30 meter spatial resolution and Sentinel provides as high as 10 meters for certain bands. I was really confused from the practical why the images were so different. However its also because you might not be able to get an image from the exact time and day for both satellites. \n\n\n\nBefore colour manipulation in snap\n\n\nHow it looks after I used the colour manipulation:\n\n\n\nAfter colour manipulation in SNAP\n\n\nTherefore, it is important to be cautious when using both datasets together and understand each datasets strengths and limitations.",

    "text": "4.1 This week I learned that there are many ways to correct data….\nMost of the data that we’d use would come analysis ready however in a situation where you are dealing with raw data you would need to correct it. Corrections involve adjusting raw sensor data to remove potential flaws in atmospheric conditions, spatial inaccuracies and topographical variations.\nMore often than not remotely sensed data contains flaws.\nA famous example is when the landsat scan line corrector failed, without the landsat corrector we got zig zags and a misaligned image.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Examples:\nGeometric correction: refers to the process of correcting for distortions in satellite \nImagery caused by multiple different factors including height, speed and direction of the imaging platform. It includes selecting ground control points (points that do not change) and matching them to a gold standard image. OS is probably the best to use as a corrected image because it has highly accurate and regularly updated geographic reference points.\n\nAtmospheric correction: Atmospheric correction is always the first thing that you should do. It is the process of removing the effects of the Earth’s atmosphere on satellite or airborne imagery. Examples include dark object subtraction (DOS), pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) and empirical line correction.\n\nOrthorectification correction: is a subset of georectification and it creates a final product whereby each pixel in the image is depicted as if it were collected from directly overhead or as close to this as possible.\nRadiometric calibration: ensures that the satellite records light correctly by converting the recorded original digital number value into the reflectivity of the outer surface of the atmosphere.",
